<p>
The <a href="https://ijcar.org">International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR)</a>, is the premier international venue on all aspects of automated reasoning. It is held biannually as a merger of leading events in automated reasoning:
</p><p>
<a href="https://cadeinc.org">CADE – Conference on Automated Deduction</a>
</p><p>
<a href="https://frocos.cs.uiowa.edu">FroCoS – Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems</a>
</p><p>
<a href="https://tableaux-conf.github.io/web">TABLEAUX – Conference on Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods Topics</a>
</p><p>
IJCAR 2026 will be held in Lisbon, Portugal, as part of the Federate Logic Conference FLoC
</p><p>
from July 26 to July 29.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.floc26.org/ijcar">https://www.floc26.org/ijcar</a>
</p><p>
IJCAR 2026 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated or interactive logical reasoning, including foundations, implementations, and applications. Original research papers and descriptions/evaluations of working automated deduction systems or proof assistant systems are solicited.
</p><p>
IJCAR topics include the following:
</p><p>
</p><p>
Logics of interest include: propositional, first-order, classical, equational, higher-order, non-classical, constructive, modal, temporal, many-valued, substructural, description, type theory.
</p><p>
Methods of interest include: tableaux, sequent calculi, resolution, model-elimination, inverse method, paramodulation, term rewriting, induction, unification, constraint solving, decision procedures, model generation, model checking, semantic guidance, interactive theorem proving, logical frameworks, AI-related methods for deductive systems, proof presentation, automated theorem proving, combination of decision or proof procedures, SAT and SMT solving, machine learning and theorem proving, integration of automated provers/proof assistants in automated test generators, program synthesisers, verified compilers, intelligent systems, agent based systems, knowledge processing systems, formal methods tools and other symbolic tools, etc.
</p><p>
Applications of interest include: verification, formal methods, program analysis and synthesis, computer mathematics, declarative programming, deductive databases, knowledge representation and processing/engineering, education, formalization of mathematics, trusted AI, etc.
</p><p>

Submission Guidelines
</p><p>
IJCAR 2026 invites submissions related to the topics of interest mentioned above.
</p><p>
All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another peer-reviewed journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:
</p><p>
Regular papers describing solid new research results. They can be up to 15 pages in LNCS style, including figures but excluding references and appendices. Where applicable, regular papers are supported by experimental validation. Submissions reporting on case studies in an industrial context are strongly invited as regular papers.
</p><p>
Short papers describing implemented systems, user experiences, case studies and domain models, etc. They can be up to 7 pages in LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.
</p><p>
All submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and readability. Proofs of theoretical results that do not fit in the page limit, executables of systems, and input data of experiments should be made available, e.g., via a reference to a website or in an appendix of the paper.
</p><p>
The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit further reviews after the rebuttal period.
</p><p>
All submissions must be formatted using the Springer LNCS styles and submitted in PDF via HotCRP:
</p><p>

</p><p>
The IJCAR 2026 proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS) as Gold Open Access, and is planned to be available online during the conference. At least one person must register for IJCAR for each accepted paper. Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them will participate in the conference and present the work.
</p><p>
The papers delivered to us will be processed according to the regular workﬂow, meaning Springer will generate both full-text HTML and PDF versions of the papers, to be made available in SpringerLink, and the full book will be available in PDF and ePub formats. The papers will be published under the CC-BY-4.0-license.
</p><p>
Best Paper Award
</p><p>
IJCAR 2024 will recognize the most outstanding submissions with a best paper award and a best student paper award at the conference.
</p><p>
Student Travel Award
</p><p>
Woody Bledsoe Travel Awards will be available to support selected students in attending the conference.
