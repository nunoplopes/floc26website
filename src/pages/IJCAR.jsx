            <p>IJCAR 2026 invites submissions related to the topics of interest mentioned above.</p>
            <p>
              All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another peer-reviewed
              journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:
            </p>
            <p>
              Regular papers describing solid new research results. They can be up to 15 pages in
              LNCS style, including figures but excluding references and appendices. Where
              applicable, regular papers are supported by experimental validation. Submissions
              reporting on case studies in an industrial context are strongly invited as regular
              papers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Short papers describing implemented systems, user experiences, case studies and domain
              models, etc. They can be up to 7 pages in LNCS style, excluding references and
              appendices.
            </p>
            <p>
              All submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, correctness,
              and readability. Proofs of theoretical results that do not fit in the page limit,
              executables of systems, and input data of experiments should be made available, e.g.,
              via a reference to a website or in an appendix of the paper.
            </p>
            <p>
              The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will have the
              option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit further reviews
              after the rebuttal period.
            </p>
            <p>
              All submissions must be formatted using the Springer LNCS styles and submitted in PDF
              via HotCRP:

              The IJCAR 2026 proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture Notes in
              Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS) as Gold Open Access, and is planned to be
              available online during the conference. At least one person must register for IJCAR
              for each accepted paper. Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at
              least one of them will participate in the conference and present the work.
            </p>
            <p>
              The papers delivered to us will be processed according to the regular workﬂow, meaning
              Springer will generate both full-text HTML and PDF versions of the papers, to be made
              available in SpringerLink, and the full book will be available in PDF and ePub
              formats. The papers will be published under the CC-BY-4.0-license.

            <p>Best Paper Award</p>
            <p>
              IJCAR 2024 will recognize the most outstanding submissions with a best paper award and
              a best student paper award at the conference.
            </p>
            <p>Student Travel Award</p>
            <p>
              Woody Bledsoe Travel Awards will be available to support selected students in
              attending the conference.
