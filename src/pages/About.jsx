              During the past forty years, there has been extensive, continuous, and growing interaction between logic and computer science. In many respects, logic provides computer science with a unifying foundational framework and modeling tools.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed">
              In fact, logic has been called "the calculus of computer science," playing a crucial role in diverse areas such as artificial intelligence, computational complexity, distributed computing, database systems, hardware design, programming languages, and software engineering.

              The Federated Logic Conference (FLoC) unites the ten leading
              international conferences focused on mathematical logic and its
              applications in computer science.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xl text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed">
              Since 1996, FLoC is organized every four years and counts with
              over 2,000 attendees.

            <p className="text-xl text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed">
              Looking ahead, FLoC is set to take place in Portugal in 2026,
              highlighting the nationâ€™s growing role as a hub for academic and
              technological excellence in computer science and logic research.
