        position: "Imperial College London",
        description: "Professor Alessandra Russo is a Professor of Applied Computational Logic in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London, where she leads the \"Structured and Probabilistic Intelligent Knowledge Engineering (SPIKE)\" research group. She currently serves as Head of the Department of Computing, Chair of the IX Imperial initiative on interdisciplinary AI-driven research, and Co-director of the School of Convergence Science in Human and Artificial Intelligence.  Since September 2021, Professor Russo has also been Co-Director of the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Safe and Trusted AI (STAI), and is seconded at the Alan Turing Institute, where she contributes to research on robust inference for Large Language Models. Her research spans a broad range of topics within AI, including Computational Logic, Knowledge Representation, Symbolic Machine Learning, Probabilistic and Distributed Inference, and more broadly, Symbolic AI. She has been a pioneer in the development of several state-of-the-art symbolic machine learning systems, with impactful applications across Intelligent Autonomous Systems, Security, Network Management, and Healthcare.  More recently, Professor Russo has focused on advancing neuro-symbolic methodologies that combine machine learning and probabilistic inference with symbolic learning and reasoning. Her work aims to enhance robustness, generalisation, and transfer learning from multimodal, unstructured data. She has led numerous research projects, has authored over 200 publications in leading AI and Software Engineering conferences and journals. Her editorial contributions include serving as Editor-in-Chief of the IET Software, Associated Editor of the ACM Computing Survey, and Associate Editor of the Theory and Practice of Logic Programming in the area of Logic and Machine Learning.",
